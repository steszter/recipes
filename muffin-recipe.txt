Ingredients:
- 2 medium eggs
- 125ml vegetable oil
- 250ml semi-skimmed milk
- 250g golden caster sugar
- 400g self-raising flour (or same quantity plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder)
- 1 tsp salt
- 100g chocolate chips or dried fruit such as sultanas or dried cherries (optional)

Directions:
 1. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 2 muffin trays with paper muffin cases.
    In a large bowl beat 2 medium eggs lightly with a handheld electric mixer for 1 min.
    
 2. Add 125ml vegetable oil and 250ml semi-skimmed milk and beat until just combined
    then add 250g golden caster sugar and whisk until you have a smooth batter.
    
 3. Sift in 400g self-raising flour and 1 tsp salt (or 400g plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder if using)
    then mix until just smooth. Be careful not to over-mix the batter as this will make the muffins tough.
    
 4. Stir in 100g chocolate chips or dried fruit if using.
 
 5. Fill muffin cases two-thirds full and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen,
    firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.
    If the trays will not fit on 1 shelf, swap the shelves around after 15 mins of cooking.
    
 6. Leave the muffins in the tin to cool for a few mins and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
